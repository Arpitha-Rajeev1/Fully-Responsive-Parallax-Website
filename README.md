# Fully-Responsive-Parallax-Website
This project uses pure HTML5 and CSS3.

Parallax Website which is a technique in the website in which the background moves at a slower pace than the foreground.

This is a very simple project yet elegant. The key is to use background-attach: fixed for the background images. They will be attached as you scroll the page and subsequent div
elements will be shown beautifully.

Try it yourself by downloading the code.
